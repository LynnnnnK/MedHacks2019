              A novel solution to problems in the field of nutrition.

          <p class="insp">
              Nutritional diseases - such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type II diabetes - are part of a global health epidemic that causes millions of deaths annually in the modernized world. One of our members has a grandfather, Tom, who suffers from hypertension. Tom needs to receive proper nutrition management and recommendations in order to manage his heart disease, and would benefit from a facile, convenient system to report his dietary log to his nutritionist. 
          </p>
          <p class="insp1">
              Meanwhile, nutritionists could provide better care for their patients by receiving a more time-sensitive, accurate record of which foods they ate, and a system that rapidly compiles and extracts conclusions about a patient's dietary habits without needing the nutritionist to read through lengthy food logs.

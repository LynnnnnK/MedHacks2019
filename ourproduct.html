          What it does:
        </h2>
        <p class="hiw">
            Our app allows users to upload photos of every meal they eat. Subsequently, using machine learning image recognition our app identifies the food contents of the plate, and subsequently determines important parameters about the meal, such as approximate calorie content, cholesterol content, sodium content, food group breakdown, etc. and sends this data to patient's nutritionist.
        </p>
        <p class="hiw1">
            The nutritionist can analyze this time-stamped data to quickly put together graphics that offer better holistic insight into the dietary habits of their patient, empowering nutritionists to give better, more accurate, nutritional recommendations to their patients.

          How we built it:
        </h2>
        <p class="hwbi">
            We used IBM-watson's visual recognition machine learning algorithm to enable a computer to process an image of a plate of food, and rapidly identify its contents, in addition to providing approximate estimates on the important nutritional parameters of the plate of food (ex. calorie content, cholesterol content, portion size, etc.)

            Challenges we ran into:
        </h2>
        <p class="cwri">
            Building an artificial intelligence system that can recognize many types of common food requires lots of time to train the computer, and thus the model we built this weekend was only constructed to recognize a few common foods as an initial proof-of-concept. 
        </p>
       
        <h2 style="text-align: center;background-color: cornsilk">
          Our Next Step:
        </h2>
        <p class="nexts">
            We want to train the algorithm to be capable of recognizing a more diverse array of food items, develop a functional user interface downloadable on iOS or Android, and implement the option of translating the app's content to other languages in order to make it more accessible to communities where English is not the first language.

            The computer that we trained can process an image of a plate of food that contains multiple different foods, and identify all at once each of the distinct foods in order to calculate approximate calorie content, food group breakdown, etc.

        <p class="ate1">
            Most alternative calorie-tracking apps that exist today on the market require users to scan images of nutrition labels or enter the names of the food (as well as the quantity they are eating) one at a time. By simplifying this entire process into taking one photo, we significantly improve the ease and accuracy with which users can report details of their dietary habits to their nutritionists.
